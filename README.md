# Goodness-of-Fit for ellipses
This Python program implements a Goodness-of-Fit measure for ellipses.  The program illustrates the use of EllipseModel() to fit an ellipse to a set of observed points obtained by digitization.  For each observed point, a line drawn from the center of the ellipse to the observed point is extended to find the intersection with the ellipse.  The error distance is defined as the distance between the observed point and the intersection point on the ellipse.  Unlike residuals that can be positive or negative, the error distances always have positive values. The fitting error is the average error distance divided by the semiminor axis of the ellipse expressed as a percentage.  This calculation scales the fitting error to the size of the ellipse and permits comparing errors for ellipses of different sizes.
